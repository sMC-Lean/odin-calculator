# odin-calculator

designed to roughly emulate the feel of on of those cheap pocket calculators that everyone has in their desk drawer;
this is my solution to the TOP final project for the foundations course;

the +/- button changes the sign of the current input value;
the % button is written so that x % y will express x as a percentage of y;
C is clear screen and CA is clear all;

input should be continuous from the last calculated value;
